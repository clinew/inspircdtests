Various scripts used to help me test InspIRCd.

afr: Test the "Admin, Friend, Referred" PKI.

ssl_crl: Test that Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) are implemented
	correctly.

ssl_log: Test that logging for OpenSSL connections and connection attempts is
	being performed.

ssl_rehash: Test server rehashing functionality with regards to client
	certificate validation.

ssl_strongcert: Test that strong peer (client) certificate validation is
	implemented correctly; this feature allows the server to use a
	whitelist of key types and minimum sizes and another whitelist for
	certificate signature algorithms.
